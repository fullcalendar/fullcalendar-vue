--------------------
FIX: Cannot target calendar api with several instances (#155)


v5.7.1 (2021-06-02)
-------------------
support for Vue 3
KNOWN BUG: templates within slots do not inherit App's
  mixins, directives, filters, and components (like #123)


v5.4.0 (2020-11-11)
-------------------

- no longer expose component as 'fullcalendar' when used globally
- eventContent slot doesn't properly destroy the Vue components inside (#111)
- global mixins, directives, filters & components work inside slots (#105)
- better compatibility with Webpack 5, deeming `resolve.fullySpecified` unnecessary ([core-5822])
- dist files now include a CJS file. ESM is still used by default in most environments ([core-5929])
- webpack upgrade note: use style-loader instead of vue-style-loader
